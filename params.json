We support Java 1.8, and as of version 1.1 (which is still being worked on) we will make great use of the new features Java 8 has to offer.\r\n\r\n\t<dependency>\r\n\t\t<groupId>com.de-swaef</groupId>\r\n\t\t<artifactId>Markdown2Pdf</artifactId>\r\n\t\t<version>1.0.2</version>\r\n\t</dependency>\r\n\r\n\r\n###Version 1.1.x and up\r\nThis version of the library will only support Java 1.8.\r\n\r\n> Version 1.1.X has not yet been made available\r\n\r\n##Building \r\n    > git clone https://github.com/Qkyrie/Markdown2Pdf.git\r\n\t> gradle wrapper\r\n\t> gradlew.bat\r\n\r\n##API examples\r\nInstead of just providing you with examples here, we created an entire Class dedicated on teaching you the basics of the API. The class can be found in the repository, but for the current version, basically, this is it:\r\n\r\n\t/**\r\n\t * Welcome to the tutorial for Markdown2Pdf.\r\n\t * We tried to create a page to demonstrate how to use our API. But in the end, we found that\r\n\t * it was a lot easier to see how to use it when effectively using our code in a working example.\r\n\t * <p/>\r\n\t * If you look at the examples listed below, you should get the hang of how you'll be able to use\r\n\t * and integrate this library in one of your own projects\r\n\t */\r\n\tpublic class Tutorial {\r\n\t\r\n\t    @Test\r\n\t    public void basicExample() throws Markdown2PdfLogicException, ConversionException {\r\n\t\r\n\t        /*\r\n\t            Let's create an instance of the markdown2PdfConverter to work with\r\n\t         */\r\n\t        Markdown2PdfConverter markdown2PdfConverter =\r\n\t                Markdown2PdfConverter.newConverter();\r\n\t\r\n\t        /*\r\n\t            We'll have to specify where our converter has to get his markdown data.\r\n\t            With Java 8 in mind, we chose for a more generic approach, where we only have to\r\n\t            implement a class defined by Markdown2PdfReader\r\n\t         */\r\n\t        markdown2PdfConverter.readFrom(() -> \"***Test***\");\r\n\t\r\n\t        /*\r\n\t            Same thing goes for our writer.
