Markdown2Pdf
============

A simple library to convert markdown to pdf using Java


##Why
Sometimes, it might come in handy to create a pdf version of a markdown file. This library combines several other libraries to leverage the hassle of converting everything by yourself.

The codebase is kept fairly small, while still providing a fluent API. 

##Prerequisites
This library only relies on the fact that you have at least Java JDK 1.7 installed. We support Java 1.8, and as of version 1.1 (which is still being worked on) we will make great use of the new features Java 8 has to offer.

##Building 
    > git clone https://github.com/Qkyrie/Markdown2Pdf.git
	> gradlew.bat

##API examples
Instead of just providing you with examples here, we created an entire Class dedicated on teaching you the basics of the API.
